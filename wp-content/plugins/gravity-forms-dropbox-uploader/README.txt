== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is the plugin still supported?**
Unfortunately no. Due to time constraints and changes in the Dropbox API - the core API integration system used in the plugin needs to be upgraded - we are no longer supporting this plugin. If you would like to take over this project please contact us on enquire@blueliquiddesigns.com.au.

**Does the uploaded file get deleted off my server once it has been uploaded to Dropbox?**
Yes. As of version 1.0.8 you now have the option to delete files off the server once they have been uploaded to Dropbox.

**How do you save the files in it's own directory in wordpress?**
As of version 1.0.4 you can use macros in the file path. Macros include #username#, #date#, #time# and #uniqueid#. Go to the Dropbox settings page and enter a path like the following in the *Dropbox Upload Directory* field.
