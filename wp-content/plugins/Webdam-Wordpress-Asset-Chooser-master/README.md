### Enabling the Webdam API integration

When enabled, the API also provides an option to store your chosen assets in your WordPress Media Library. To enable the API integration select 'Enable Webdam API Integration' in your WordPress Settings > Webdam sectionâ€”then follow the prompts to enter your credentials and authenticate your website to use your Webdam account.
